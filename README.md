# Diamond Price Prediction

## Introduction

Developed the "DiamondPricePrediction" project, utilizing a Kaggle dataset comprising 150,000+ diamond entries. The objective was to predict diamond prices through regression analysis. The dataset includes 10 independent variables, such as carat, cut quality, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z), with the unique identifier 'id.' The target variable is the price of the diamond.

## Project Highlights

- Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the diamond dataset.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms achieving a 95% accuracy rate in predicting diamond prices.
- Established a robust pipeline for automatic data updates, ensuring the model's relevance over time.
